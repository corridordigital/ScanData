We shall take the simpleminded view that a theory is just a model of the universe, or a restricted part of it, and a set of rules that relate quantities in the model to observations that we make. It exists only in our minds and does not have any other reality (whatever that might mean). A theory is a good theory if it satisfies two requirements. It must accurately describe a large class of observations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definite predictions about the results of future observations.

People often employ this equation to calculate how much energy would be produced if, say, a bit of matter was converted into pure electromagnetic radiation. (Because the speed of light is a large number, the answer is a lot—the weight of matter converted to energy in the bomb that destroyed the city of Hiroshima was less than one ounce.) But the equation also tells us that if the energy of an object increases, so does its mass, that is, its resistance to acceleration, or change in speed.

The kinetic energy of a moving object is identical to the energy you must expend in causing it to move. Therefore, the faster an object moves, the more kinetic energy it possesses. But according to the equivalence of energy and mass, kinetic energy adds to an object’s mass, so the faster an object moves, the harder it is to further increase the object’s speed.

As an object approaches the speed of light, its mass rises ever more quickly, so it takes more and more energy to speed it up further. According to the theory of relativity, an object can in fact never reach the speed of light, because by then its mass would have become infinite, and by the equivalence of mass and energy, it would have taken an infinite amount of energy to get it there. This is the reason that any normal object is forever confined by relativity to move at speeds slower than the speed of light. Only light, or other waves that have no intrinsic mass, can move at the speed of light.

Bodies such as the earth are not made to move on curved orbits bv a force called gravity; instead they move in curved orbits because they follow the nearest thing to a straight path in a curved space, which is called a geodesic. Technically speaking, a geodesic is defined as the shortest (or longest) path between two nearby points.

Eventually, however, the star will run out of its hydrogen and other nuclear fuels. Paradoxically, the more fuel a star starts off with, the sooner it runs out. This is because the more massive the star is, the hotter it needs to be to balance its gravitational attraction. And the hotter the star, the faster the nuclear fusion reaction and the sooner it will use up its fuel. Our sun has probably got enough fuel to last another five billion years or so, but more massive stars can use up their fuel in as little as one hundred million years, much less than the age of the universe.

We learned from our earlier thought experiment aboard the rocket ship that gravity slows time, and the stronger the gravity, the greater the effect. The astronaut on the star is in a stronger gravitational field than his companions in orbit, so what to him is one second will be more than one second on their clocks. And as he rides the star’s collapse inward, the field he experiences will grow stronger and stronger, so the interval between his signals will appear successively longer to those on the spaceship. This stretching of time would be very small before 10:59:59,

A supernova explosion is so huge that it can give off more light than all the other stars in its galaxy combined. One example of this is the supernova whose remnants we see as the Crab Nebula. The Chinese recorded it in 1054. Though the star that exploded was five thousand light-years away, it was visible to the naked eye for months and shone so brightly that you could see it even during the day and read by it at night. A supernova five hundred light-years away— one-tenth as far—would be one hundred times brighter and could literally turn night into day. To understand the violence of such an explosion, just consider that its light would rival that of the sun, even though it is tens of millions of times farther away. (Recall that our sun resides at the neighborly distance of eight light-minutes.)

Some scientists believe that advanced life is likely to evolve only in regions of galaxies in which there are not too many stars—"zones of life"— because in denser regions phenomena such as supernovas would be common enough to regularly snuff out any evolutionary beginnings. On the average, hundreds of thousands of supernovas explode somewhere in the universe each day. A supernova happens in any particular galaxy about once a century. But that’s just the average. Unfortunately—for astronomers at least—the last supernova recorded in the Milky Way occurred in 1604, before the invention of the telescope.

When the earth was newly condensed, it was very hot and without an atmosphere. In the course of time, it cooled and acquired an atmosphere from the emission of gases from the rocks. This early atmosphere was not one in which we could have survived. It contained no oxygen, but it did contain a lot of other gases that are poisonous to us, such as hydrogen sulfide (the gas that gives rotten eggs their smell). There are, however, other primitive forms of life that can flourish under such conditions. It is thought that they developed in the oceans, possibly as a result of chance combinations of atoms into large structures, called macromolecules, that were capable of assembling other atoms in the ocean into similar structures. They would thus have reproduced themselves and multiplied. In some cases there would be errors in the reproduction. Mostly these errors would have been such that the new macromolecule could not reproduce itself and eventually would have been destroyed. However, a few of the errors would have produced new macromolecules that were even better at reproducing themselves. They would have therefore had an advantage and would have tended to replace the original macromolecules. In this way a process of evolution was started that led to the development of more and more complicated, self-reproducing organisms. The first primitive forms of life consumed various materials, including hydrogen sulfide, and released oxygen. This gradually changed the atmosphere to the composition that it has today, and allowed the development of higher forms of life such as fish, reptiles, mammals, and ultimately the human race.

by predicting that the universe began with the big bang, a time when the density of the universe and the curvature of space-time would have been infinite, the theory of general relativity predicts that there is a point in the universe where the theory itself breaks down, or fails. Such a point is an example of what mathematicians call a singularity. When a theory predicts singularities such as infinite density and curvature, it is a sign that the theory must somehow be modified. General relativity is an incomplete theory because it cannot tell us how the universe started off.

to measure its initial state—that is, its present position and its velocity—accurately. The obvious way to do this is to shine light on the particle. Some of the waves of light will be scattered by the particle. These can be detected by the observer and will indicate the particle’s position. However, light of a given wavelength has only limited sensitivity: you will not be able to determine the position of the particle more accurately than the distance between the wave crests of the light. Thus, in order to measure the position of the particle precisely, it is necessary to use light of a short wavelength, that is, of a high frequency. By Planck’s quantum hypothesis, though, you cannot use an arbitrarily small amount of light: you have to use at least one quantum, whose energy is higher at higher frequencies. Thus, the more accurately you wish to measure the position of a particle, the more energetic the quantum of light you must shoot at it. According to quantum theory, even one quantum of light will disturb the particle: it will change its velocity in a way that cannot be predicted. And the more energetic the quantum of light you use, the greater the likely disturbance. That means that for more precise measurements of position, when you will have to employ a more energetic quantum, the velocity of the particle will be disturbed by a larger amount. So the more accurately you try to measure the position of the particle, the less accurately you can measure its speed, and vice versa. Heisenberg showed that the uncertainty in the position of the particle times the uncertainty in its velocity times the mass of the particle can never be smaller than a certain fixed quantity. That means, for instance, if you halve the uncertainty in position, you must double the uncertainty in velocity, and vice versa. Nature forever constrains us to making this trade-off.

SO WHAT’S the buy side? I don’t really know the difference between the sell side and the buy side, but I soon learn. Imagine the relationship in biblical terms. Old Testament. If you’re on the buy side, you roll into the marketplace with a wagon filled with the pharaoh’s gold, charged with buying the best products you can. The pharaoh will compensate you for good purchases. Now, though you have a proprietary relationship with the pharaoh’s money, it’s not your money, and the only thing you stand to lose is what you might gain. And you stand to gain a lot if your performance is good. Like, the next time you roll into the marketplace your wagon might have custom rims or built-in GPS. But you’re not the only wagon of gold. So when you get there you have to be ready. The open market is buzzing. There are merchants everywhere. If you’re on the sell side, you want the pharaoh’s buyer as your customer. Every merchant wants to get the highest price he can for all of his goods, and they all want to rid themselves of the crap in their inventory. They want the highest revenues. Competition between the merchants for your attention is great. They need you. Some of them offer you boat rides down the Nile with a few “mistresses of the house,” or a tomb in the pyramids, or a weekend in Mesopotamia with some really good lotus. Whatever. But a lot of them are phonies, and if you end up buying the crap, or paying too much, maybe the pharaoh doesn’t let you drive the wagon next time. Or worse, you have to go back to being a merchant. If I buy some livestock from the guy who took me down the Nile on Thursday night and I can sell it at a profit to the guy I went to Mesopotamia with on Friday, then I’m going to do it. So in one sense, you need the sell side almost as much as they need you. On Wall Street the buy side can buy or sell—they’re the customer. The sell side is selling information, research, and customer facilitation.

Whenever you go out-of-doors, draw the chin in, carry the crown of the head high, and fill the lungs to the utmost; drink in the sunshine; greet your friends with a smile, and put soul into every handclasp. Do not fear being misunderstood and do not waste a minute thinking about your enemies. Try to fix firmly in your mind what you would like to do; and then, without veering off direction, you will move straight to the goal. Keep your mind on the great and splendid things you would like to do, and then, as the days go gliding away, you will find yourself unconsciously seizing upon the opportunities that are required for the fulfillment of your desire, just as the coral insect takes from the running tide the element it needs. Picture in your mind the able, earnest, useful person you desire to be, and the thought you hold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual . . . Thought is supreme. Preserve a right mental attitude – the attitude of courage, frankness, and good cheer. To think rightly is to create. All things come through desire and every sincere prayer is answered.

But the very instant we break the law, we shall get into endless trouble. The law is this: Always make the other person feel important. John Dewey, as we have already noted, said that the desire to be important is the deepest urge in human nature; and William James said: ‘The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.’ As I have already pointed out, it is this urge that differentiates us from the animals.

In an article in Bits and Pieces,1 some suggestions are made on how to keep a disagreement from becoming an argument: Welcome the disagreement. Remember the slogan, ‘When two partners always agree, one of them is not necessary.’ If there is some point you haven’t thought about, be thankful if it is brought to your attention. Perhaps this disagreement is your opportunity to be corrected before you make a serious mistake. Distrust your first instinctive impression. Our first natural reaction in a disagreeable situation is to be defensive. Be careful. Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction. It may be you at your worst, not your best. Control your temper. Remember, you can measure the size of a person by what makes him or her angry. Listen first. Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Do not resist, defend or debate. This only raises barriers. Try to build bridges of understanding. Don’t build higher barriers of misunderstanding. Look for areas of agreement. When you have heard your opponents out, dwell first on the points and areas on which you agree. Be honest. Look for areas where you can admit error and say so. Apologize for your mistakes. It will help disarm your opponents and reduce defensiveness. Promise to think over your opponents’ ideas and study them carefully. And mean it. Your opponents may be right. It is a lot easier at this stage to agree to think about their points than to move rapidly ahead and find yourself in a position where your opponents can say: ‘We tried to tell you, but you wouldn’t listen.’ Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Anyone who takes the time to disagree with you is interested in the same things you are. Think of them as people who really want to help you, and you may turn your opponents into friends. Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem. Suggest that a new meeting be held later that day or the next day, when all the facts may be brought to bear. In preparation for this meeting, ask yourself some hard questions: Could my opponents be right? Partly right? Is there truth or merit in their position or argument? Is my reaction one that will relieve the problem, or will it just relieve any frustration? Will my reaction drive my opponents further away or draw them closer to me? Will my reaction elevate the estimation good people have of me? Will I win or lose? What price will I have to pay if I win? If I am quiet about it, will the disagreement blow over? Is this difficult situation an opportunity for me?

We sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without any resistance or heavy emotion, but if we are told we are wrong, we resent the imputation and harden our hearts. We are incredibly heedless in the formation of our beliefs, but find ourselves filled with an illicit passion for them when anyone proposes to rob us of their companionship. It is obviously not the ideas themselves that are dear to us, but our self-esteem which is threatened . . . The little word ‘my’ is the most important one in human affairs, and properly to reckon with it is the beginning of wisdom. It has the same force whether it is ‘my’ dinner, ‘my’ dog, and ‘my’ house, or ‘my’ father, ‘my’ country, and ‘my’ God. We not only resent the imputation that our watch is wrong, or our car shabby, but that our conception of the canals of Mars, of the pronunciation of ‘Epictetus,’ of the medicinal value of salicin, or of the date of Sargon I is subject to revision. We like to continue to believe what we have been accustomed to accept as true, and the resentment aroused when doubt is cast upon any of our assumptions leads us to seek every manner of excuse for clinging to it. The result is that most of our so-called reasoning consists in finding arguments for going on believing as we already do.

Because he had singled out a specific accomplishment, rather than just making general flattering remarks, his praise became much more meaningful to the person to whom it was given. Everybody likes to be praised, but when praise is specific, it comes across as sincere – not something the other person may be saying just to make one feel good. Remember, we all crave appreciation and recognition, and will do almost anything to get it. But nobody wants insincerity. Nobody wants flattery. Let me repeat: The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way of life. Talking about changing people. If you and I will inspire the people with whom we come in contact to a realisation of the hidden treasures they possess, we can do far more than change people. We can literally transform them. Exaggeration?

We are making use of only a small part of our physical and mental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits.

The effective leader should keep the following guidelines in mind when it is necessary to change attitudes or behaviour: 1 Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself and concentrate on the benefits to the other person. 2 Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do. 3. Be empathetic. Ask yourself what is it the other person really wants. 4 Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest. 5 Match those benefits to the other person’s wants. 6. When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit. We could give a curt order like this: ‘John, we have customers coming in tomorrow and I need the stockroom cleaned out. So sweep it out, put the stock in neat piles on the shelves and polish the counter.’ Or we could express the same idea by showing John the benefits he will get from doing the task: ‘John, we have a job that should be completed right away. If it is done now, we won’t be faced with it later. I am bringing some customers in tomorrow to show our facilities. I would like to show them the stock-room, but it is in poor shape. If you could sweep it out, put the stock in neat piles on the shelves, and polish the counter, it would make us look efficient and you will have done your part to provide a good company image.’

IN A NUTSHELL BE A LEADER A leader’s job often includes changing your people’s attitudes and behaviour. Some suggestions to accomplish this: PRINCIPLE 1 Begin with praise and honest appreciation. PRINCIPLE 2 Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly. PRINCIPLE 3 Talk about your own mistakes before criticising the other person. PRINCIPLE 4 Ask questions instead of giving direct orders. PRINCIPLE 5 Let the other person save face. PRINCIPLE 6 Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be ‘hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.’ PRINCIPLE 7 Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to. PRINCIPLE 8 Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct. PRINCIPLE 9 Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.

For example, competition among profit-seeking firms may still be the key driving force of capitalism, as in Smith’s scheme. But it is not between small, anonymous firms which, accepting consumer tastes, fight it out by increasing the efficiency in the use of given technology. Today, competition is among huge multinational companies, with the ability not only to influence prices but to redefine technologies in a short span of time (think about the battle between Apple and Samsung) and to manipulate consumer tastes through brand-image building and advertising.

But much of the spread happened on the periphery of capitalism, in Latin America and Asia. This was the result of something that you would not normally associate with the word ‘free’ – that is, force, or at least the threat of using it. Colonization was the obvious route to ‘unfree free trade’, but even many countries that were not colonized were also forced to adopt free trade. Through ‘gunboat diplomacy’, they were forced to sign unequal treaties that deprived them of, among other things, tariff autonomy (the right to set their own tariffs).11 They were allowed to use only a low uniform tariff rate (3–5 per cent) – enough to raise some government revenue but not enough for infant industry protection. The most infamous unequal treaty is the Nanking Treaty, which China was forced to sign in 1842, following its defeat in the Opium War. But the unequal treaties had started with the Latin American countries, upon their independence in the 1810s and the 1820s. Between the 1820s and the 1850s, a string of other countries were forced to sign them – the Ottoman Empire (Turkey’s predecessor), Persia (Iran today) and Siam (today’s Thailand), and even Japan. The Latin American unequal treaties expired in the 1870s and the 1880s, but the Asian ones lasted well into the twentieth century. The inability to protect and promote their infant industries, whether due to direct colonial rule or to unequal treaties, was a huge contributing factor to the economic retrogression in Asia and Latin America during this period, when they saw negative per capita income growths (at the rates of -0.1 and -0.04 per cent per year, respectively).

After a big financial crisis like the 1929 Wall Street crash or the 2008 global financial crisis, private-sector spending falls. Debts go unpaid, which forces banks to reduce their lending. Being unable to borrow, firms and individuals cut their spending. This, in turn, reduces demands for other firms and individuals that used to sell to them (e.g., firms selling to consumers, firms selling machinery to other firms, workers selling labour services to firms). The demand level in the economy spirals down. In this environment, the government is the only economic actor that can maintain the level of demand in the economy by spending more than it earns, that is, by running a budget deficit. However, in the days of the Great Depression, the strong belief in the doctrine of the balanced budget prevented such a course of action. As tax revenues were falling due to reduced levels of economic activity, the only way for them to balance their budgets was to cut their spending, leaving nothing to arrest the downward demand spiral.18 To make things worse, the Gold Standard meant that their central banks could not increase the supply of money for fear of compromising the value of their currencies. With restricted money supply, credit became scarce, restricting private-sector activities and thus reducing demand even further.

Many governments practised selective industrial policy that deliberately promoted targeted ‘strategic’ industries through a range of measures, such as trade protection and subsidies. The US government officially had no industrial policy but greatly influenced the country’s industrial development by providing massive research funding to advanced industries such as computers (funded by the Pentagon), semi-conductors (US Navy), aircraft (US Air Forces), the internet (the DARPA, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and pharmaceuticals and life sciences (National Institutes of Health).25

The Golden Age started to unravel with the suspension of US dollar–gold convertibility in 1971. In the Bretton Woods system, the old Gold Standard was abandoned on the recognition that it made macroeconomic management too rigid, as seen during the Great Depression. But the system was still ultimately anchored in gold, because the US dollar, which had fixed exchange rates with all the other major currencies, was freely convertible to gold (at $35 per ounce). This, of course, was based on the assumption that the dollar was ‘as good as gold’ – not an unreasonable assumption when the US was producing about half of the world’s output and there was an acute dollar shortage all around the world, as everyone wanted to buy American things.

Ronald Reagan, the former actor and a former governor of California, became the US president in 1981 and outdid Margaret Thatcher. The Reagan government aggressively cut the higher income tax rates, explaining that these cuts would give the rich greater incentives to invest and create wealth, as they could keep more of the fruits of their investments. Once they created more wealth, it was argued, the rich would spend more, creating more jobs and incomes for everyone else; this is known as the trickle-down theory. At the same time, subsidies to the poor (especially in housing) were cut and the minimum wage frozen so that they had a greater incentive to work harder. When you think about it, this was a curious logic – why do we need to make the rich richer to make them work harder but make the poor poorer for the same purpose? Curious or not, this logic, known as supply-side economics, became the foundational belief of economic policy for the next three decades in the US – and beyond.

A GENETIC EXPLANATION isn't the only possible answer to Yali's ques- tion. Another one, popular with inhabitants of northern Europe, invokes the supposed stimulatory effects of their homeland's cold climate and the inhibitory effects of hot, humid, tropical climates on human creativity and energy. Perhaps the seasonally variable climate at high latitudes poses more diverse challenges than does a seasonally constant tropical climate. Perhaps cold climates require one to be more technologically inventive to survive, because one must build a warm home and make warm clothing, whereas one can survive in the tropics with simpler housing and no cloth- ing. Or the argument can be reversed to reach the same conclusion: the long winters at high latitudes leave people with much time in which to sit indoors and invent.

Think of an item you own that you absolutely love, something that you wouldn't want to lose. Perhaps it is your car, your home, your money, an electronic gadget, a piece of jewelry, a special memento, or even a religious or sacred object. The point is to pick an object that you feel strongly about, something that is tied to your sense of self. Very few people who look honestly and deeply will find that there is nothing in the world that doesn't fit this description. On a blank piece of paper, write down the item and then answer the following questions: Why do you feel so strongly about this item? What sense of security does it give to you? How is this item tied to your identity or sense of self? How does it boost your ego? Are you pleased to show this item to others? Or it is an item that you show no one and secretly feel special for having? Does owning it make you feel more attractive than others, wealthier, more secure, more intelligent, or more spiritual? Be truthful, reacting honestly from your current emotions. There are no right or wrong answers. The point is to explore your deeper associations with material things. Now, crumple up the piece of paper and discard it. Close your eyes and imagine that this item no longer exists in your life. How do you feel? What would life be like without it? Who would you be without this item? Now that you have explored the idea of losing this item, ask yourself the following questions: Is this attachment affecting your relationships with the people in your life? Is your attachment causing you to play it safe and not pursue other things you really want? Can you think of any times when you've altered your actions because of this item? How does this attachment affect your personal freedom? Finally, do you want to keep this level of attachment? Or do you want to decrease it, or even let it go? The choice is always yours.

In a positive vein, if you are absolutely convinced that you are meant to be a great success in life, and that there was nothing in the world that could stop you from achieving great things as long as you threw yourself wholeheartedly into every activity, and persisted until you succeeded, you would become an irresistible force of nature. The depth of your belief and the strength of your conviction would dramatically increase the power of your personality. If you really believed in your ability to succeed greatly, you would become unstoppable. The Four Cs of Inner Confidence You can develop this kind of belief, this inner confidence, by developing what I call “the four Cs.” 1. Clarity: Decide exactly what it is you want to accomplish and exactly the kind of person you wish to become. 2. Conviction: Develop the unshakable belief that you can do anything that you can put your mind to. 3. Commitment: Resolve to do whatever is necessary; develop the willingness to pay the price, in advance, for any success you desire. 4. Consistency: Resolve to work on your goals every day, morning, noon, and night, until they are accomplished.

Great men and women are those who absolutely believe that they are put on this earth to do something wonderful with their lives. They have a vision of something greater or better than their current circumstances. Personal greatness means having a sense of destiny and a conviction that your thoughts and your imagination are the only real limits to your possibilities. William James said, “Compared to what we ought to be, we are only half awake. We are making use of only a small part of our physical and mental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses powers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use.” The founder of Success magazine, Orison Swett Marden, once said, “There are powers inside of you, which, if you could discover and use, would make of you everything you ever dreamed or imagined you could become.” In a five-year study of leaders, reported on in his book, “Leaders,” Warren Bennis discovered that each of them consciously avoided the “comfort zone” by continuously setting higher goals. They never allowed themselves to become complacent. They lived their lives fully extended, always striving to be and do more. To develop unshakable self-confidence, you need to see yourself and think of yourself as a leader, and to do what leaders do. You need to stretch yourself toward the outermost boundaries of your potential. You need to set goals that draw out of you the very best that is in you. You need to work toward objectives that cause you to feel a sense of mastery and peak performance. And it all begins with a pad of paper, a pen, and you.

A Simple Technique Let me now give you a simple technique that has transformed my life and the life of almost every person who has ever used it. It is simply this: get yourself a spiral notebook, the kind used in school for taking notes. Begin each day by sitting down with this notebook and writing out your main goals in the present tense, as though they were already a reality. Use strong, definite words like, “I earn,” “I achieve,” or “I am.” You can write other things in this notebook if you like, but the most important action is that you take five minutes each day to write and rewrite your major goals, without referring back to what you wrote yesterday. Hand writing your goals is called a “psychoneuromotor activity.” Each time you write out your goals, you drive them deeper into your subconscious mind. You increase the intensity of your desire and the depth of your belief. You activate the mental laws of concentration and attraction and correspondence. You focus your mental powers and increase your confidence that the goal is achievable. By rewriting your goals every day, they become clearer and stronger and take on a power of their own. This exercise impresses your goals so deeply into your subconscious mind that they will eventually “lock on,” and you will begin to move irresistibly and unstoppably toward their achievement. When this happens, your future will be guaranteed. As you develop this ability to set and achieve whatever it is you want in life, you will develop the kind of confidence that comes from positive “knowing” rather than positive thinking. You will become unstoppable. Action Exercises 1. Decide today exactly what you want in life. Set your goals as if you had no limitations, and whatever you wrote, you could achieve. 2. Make a list of 10 goals that you would like to achieve in the next 12 months or so. 3. Write your goals in the present, positive, personal tense. For example, you could write, “I earn $XXX,XXX by this date.” This is personal, positive, and in the present tense. 4. Set deadlines on each of your goals, and set subdeadlines if necessary. 5. Make a list of everything you will have to do to achieve your goal and organize the list by sequence and priority. This now becomes your plan. 6. Review your list and ask, “If I could be guaranteed to achieve any one goal on my list within 24 hours, which one goal would have the greatest positive impact on my life?” 7. Take this number-one goal, your major definite purpose, write it at the top of a new page in the present, personal, positive tense. Make a list of everything you could do to achieve this goal, organize it into a plan, and take action on your plan immediately. 8. Do something every day, seven days per week on your major goal. Resolve to persist on this goal until you succeed, no matter how hard it becomes or how much time it takes. This process of setting and achieving one big goal will build your self-confidence to the point where you will become unstoppable for the rest of your life.

The quality of a person’s life is in direct proportion to their commitment to excellence, no matter what their chosen field. —Vince Lombardi You will only be happy, satisfied, and capable of enjoying high levels of self-confidence when you know that you are absolutely excellent at doing something that is important to yourself and others. What is it? What could it be? These are two of the great questions of life. Fortunately, you and every other person has the inborn ability to become excellent at what you do, and to achieve peak performance in your life and in your chosen field. You have the capacity to function in the “exceptional” range and to achieve mastery in any area that is important to you. The development of lasting self-confidence requires nothing less.

Je suis néanmoins persuadé que de tels problèmes seraient plus faciles à résoudre si les rapports avec les immigrés étaient envisagés dans un esprit différent. Lorsqu’on sent sa langue méprisée, sa religion bafouée, sa culture dévalorisée, on réagit en affichant avec ostentation les signes de sa différence ; lorsqu’on se sent, au contraire, respecté, lorsqu’on sent qu’on a sa place dans le pays où l’on a choisi de vivre, alors on réagit autrement. Pour aller résolument vers l’autre, il faut avoir les bras ouverts et la tête haute, et l’on ne peut avoir les bras ouverts que si l’on a la tête haute. Si, à chaque pas que l’on fait, on a le sentiment de trahir les siens, et de se renier, la démarche en direction de l’autre est viciée ; si celui dont j’étudie la langue ne respecte pas la mienne, parler sa langue cesse d’être un geste d’ouverture, il devient un acte d’allégeance et de soumission.

Quand j’évoque l’influence des sociétés sur les religions, je songe par exemple au fait que lorsque les musulmans du tiers-monde s’en prennent violemment à l’Occident, ce n’est pas seulement parce qu’ils sont musulmans et que l’Occident est chrétien, c’est aussi parce qu’ils sont pauvres, dominés, bafoués, et que l’Occident est riche et puissant. J’ai écrit « aussi ». Mais j’ai pensé « surtout ». Parce qu’en observant les mouvements islamistes militants d’aujourd’hui, je devine aisément l’influence du tiers-mondisme des années soixante, tant dans le discours que dans les méthodes ; en revanche, j’ai beau chercher dans l’histoire de l’islam, je ne leur trouve aucun ancêtre évident. Ces mouvements ne sont pas un pur produit de l’histoire musulmane, ils sont le produit de notre époque, de ses tensions, de ses distorsions, de ses pratiques, de ses désespérances.

Quand la modernité porte la marque de « l’Autre », il n’est pas surprenant de voir certaines personnes brandir les symboles de l’archaïsme pour affirmer leur différence. On l’observe aujourd’hui chez certains musulmans, femmes et hommes, mais le phénomène n’est pas l’apanage d’une culture ni d’une religion. En Russie, par exemple, il a fallu attendre la révolution bolchevique pour qu’on renonce enfin au vieux calendrier julien. Parce qu’en s’alignant sur le calendrier grégorien, on avait le sentiment d’admettre que, dans le bras de fer quasiment millénaire entre l’orthodoxie et le catholicisme, c’est celui-ci qui avait eu le dernier mot. Ce n’était qu’un symbole ? Tout, dans l’Histoire, s’exprime par des symboles. La grandeur et l’abaissement, la victoire et la défaite, le bonheur, la prospérité, la misère. Et plus que tout, l’identité. Pour qu’un changement soit accepté, il ne suffit pas qu’il soit conforme à l’esprit du temps. Il faut aussi qu’au niveau des symboles il ne heurte pas, qu’il ne donne pas à ceux qu’on incite au changement l’impression de se renier.

On imagine bien, a fortiori, le sentiment qu’ont pu éprouver les différents peuples non occidentaux pour qui, depuis de nombreuses générations déjà, chaque pas dans l’existence s’accompagne d’un sentiment de capitulation, et de négation de soi. Il leur a fallu reconnaître que leur savoir-faire était dépassé, que tout ce qu’ils produisaient ne valait rien comparé à ce que produisait l’Occident, que leur attachement à leur médecine traditionnelle relevait de la superstition, que leur valeur militaire n’était plus qu’une réminiscence, que leurs grands hommes qu’ils avaient appris à vénérer, les grands poètes, les savants, les soldats, les saints, les voyageurs, ne comptaient pour rien aux yeux du reste du monde, que leur religion était suspectée de barbarie, que leur langue n’était plus étudiée que par une poignée de spécialistes alors qu’eux-mêmes se devaient d’étudier les langues des autres s’ils voulaient survivre et travailler et garder un contact avec le reste de l’humanité… Lorsqu’ils parlent avec un Occidental, c’est toujours dans sa langue à lui, presque jamais dans la leur ; au sud et à l’est de la Méditerranée, on trouve des millions de personnes capables de parler l’anglais, le français, l’espagnol, l’italien. En face, combien d’Anglais, de Français, d’Espagnols, d’Italiens ont jugé utile d’étudier l’arabe ou le turc ?

Il est évident, néanmoins, que le déclin puis l’effondrement du monde communiste ont joué un rôle déterminant dans cette évolution. Cela fait tout de même plus d’un siècle que le marxisme promet d’établir sur l’ensemble de la planète une société d’un type nouveau d’où l’idée de Dieu serait bannie ; l’échec de ce projet, tant aux plans économique et politique qu’aux plans moral et intellectuel, a eu pour conséquence de réhabiliter les croyances qu’il avait voulu jeter aux poubelles de l’Histoire. Refuge spirituel, refuge identitaire, la religion fut, de la Pologne à l’Afghanistan, un point de ralliement évident pour tous ceux qui se battaient contre le communisme. Aussi la défaite de Marx et de Lénine est-elle apparue comme une revanche des religions, au moins autant que comme une victoire du capitalisme, du libéralisme, ou de l’Occident.

mais il arrive à chacun de se rebiffer lorsqu’il sent qu’une menace pèse sur un élément significatif de « son identité – sa langue, sa religion, les différents symboles de sa culture, ou son indépendance. Aussi, l’époque actuelle se passe-t-elle sous le double signe de l’harmonisation et de la dissonance. Jamais les hommes n’ont eu autant de choses en commun, autant de connaissances communes, autant de références communes, autant d’images, autant de paroles, autant d’instruments partagés, mais cela pousse les uns et les autres à affirmer davantage leur différence. Ce que je viens d’exprimer peut être observé à l’œil nu. Il ne fait pas de doute que la mondialisation accélérée provoque, en réaction, un renforcement du besoin d’identité. Et aussi, en raison de l’angoisse existentielle qui accompagne des changements aussi brusques, un renforcement du besoin de spiritualité. Or seule l’appartenance religieuse apporte, ou du moins cherche à apporter, une réponse à ces deux besoins.

Mais je tenais à l’évoquer ici parce qu’elle est essentielle à la notion d’universalité. Celle-ci serait vide de sens si elle ne présupposait pas qu’il y a des valeurs qui concernent tous les humains, sans distinction aucune. Ces valeurs priment tout. Les traditions ne méritent d’être respectées que dans la mesure où elles sont respectables, c’est-à-dire dans l’exacte mesure où elles respectent les droits fondamentaux des hommes et des femmes. Respecter des « traditions » ou des lois discriminatoires, c’est mépriser leurs victimes. Tous les peuples et toutes les doctrines ont produit, à certains moments de leur histoire, des comportements qui se sont avérés, avec l’évolution des mentalités, incompatibles avec la dignité humaine ; nulle part on ne les abolira d’un trait de plume, mais cela ne dispense pas de les dénoncer et d’œuvrer à leur disparition. Tout ce qui concerne les droits fondamentaux – le droit de vivre en citoyen à part entière sur la terre de ses pères sans subir aucune persécution ni discrimination ; le droit de vivre, où qu’on se trouve, dans la dignité ; le droit de choisir librement sa vie, ses amours, ses croyances, dans le respect de la liberté d’autrui ; le droit d’accéder sans entraves au savoir, à la santé, à une vie décente et honorable –, tout cela, et la liste n’est pas limitative, ne peut être dénié à nos semblables sous prétexte de préserver une croyance, une pratique ancestrale ou une tradition. Dans ce domaine, il faut tendre vers l’universalité, et même, s’il le faut, vers l’uniformité, parce que l’humanité, tout en étant multiple, est d’abord une. Et la spécificité de chaque civilisation ? Bien sûr, il faut la respecter, mais d’une autre manière, et sans jamais se départir de sa lucidité. Parallèlement au combat pour l’universalité des valeurs, il est impératif de lutter contre l’uniformisation appauvrissante, contre l’hégémonie idéologique ou politique ou économique ou médiatique, contre l’unanimisme bêtifiant, contre tout ce qui bâillonne les multiples expressions linguistiques, artistiques, intellectuelles. Contre tout ce qui va dans le sens d’un monde monocorde et infantilisant. Un combat pour la défense de certaines pratiques, de certaines traditions culturelles, mais un combat perspicace, exigeant, sélectif, sans frilosité, sans frayeurs excessives, et constamment ouvert sur l’avenir.

Au plan global, comme au sein de chaque société, personne ne devrait se sentir bafoué, dévalorisé, raillé, « diabolisé », au point d’être contraint de dissimuler honteusement sa religion, ou sa couleur, ou sa langue, ou son nom, ou n’importe quel élément constitutif de son identité, pour pouvoir vivre au milieu des autres. Chacun devrait pouvoir assumer, la tête haute, sans peur et sans rancœur, chacune de ses appartenances.

Accepting responsibility is not an option that is open to the individual. It is mandatory. It is an absolute fact of human existence. You do not have the luxury of blaming others or making excuses for parts of your life that are not satisfactory. As Henry Ford II said, “Never complain, never explain.” No one makes you do anything or feel anything. You are where you are and what you are because you have decided to be there. Everything that you are or ever will be is entirely up to you. If there is any effect in your life that you’re not happy about, it is solely up to you to change the causes. You are completely responsible.

Inactions also have consequences. What are called “crimes of omission” are often more serious to your long-term prospects than the mistakes you make. Omitting to think through your values, set clear goals, make plans, commit to excellence, and so on, can be disastrous to your possibilities of great success.

The starting point of using positive self-talk is to interpret everything that happens to you in a favorable way. Become what W. Clement Stone called an “inverse paranoid.” Imagine that the whole world is in a giant conspiracy to help you to be successful and happy. Imagine that everything that happens is happening to teach you something valuable and to move you closer to achieving your most important goals. Just as a paranoid is convinced that there is a conspiracy against him, an inverse paranoid is convinced that there is a conspiracy for him or her.

Whenever you think of an upcoming event, talk to yourself in positive language. Perhaps the most powerful affirmation of all for building self-confidence is for you to repeat, over and over, 50–100 times per day, the words, “I can do it! I can do it! I can do it!” These simple words are the verbal antidote to the fear of failure, which, as you know, is the great destroyer of self-confidence and probably the primary reason for failure in adult life. However, you can diminish the fear of failure in any situation by repeating, “I can do it! I can do it! I can do it!” Whenever you think of an event that causes you to feel nervous or insecure, whenever you have something coming up that fills you with trepidation, exert your powers of self-talk and self-suggestion by saying, “I can do it!” to cancel out and override any negative emotions associated with it.

Your potential is unlimited using affirmations. Remember that affirmations are a way of programming your subconscious mind. By repeated affirmations, you can instill within your mind powerful, positive commands that will eventually determine your automatic thoughts, feelings, and responses. In order for affirmations to work, they must be phrased using the three Ps. They must be in the present tense, positive, and personal. The affirmations, “I can do it! I like myself! I feel terrific!” are all positive, present tense, and personal. The subconscious is very literal in nature and can only accept commands phrased in the present tense. For some reason, it ignores negative commands and focuses only on the positive message.

An effective way of visualizing is a peak performance technique called “mental rehearsal.” In mental rehearsal, you go through an upcoming event in your mind, detail by detail, and imagine it happening perfectly, with you being completely successful in the end. Prior to any event of importance, you recall and relive a previous experience where you performed well. You take a few moments to replay in your mind a picture of the last time you did this particular activity successfully. If you have to write an exam of any kind, take a few moments to close your eyes, breathe deeply, and see yourself writing the exam easily, knowing all the answers. If you have to make a sales call, take a few moments prior to the sales call, close your eyes and see yourself in the sales call, perfectly relaxed, positive, calm, and in complete control.

Keep your vision clearly before you and take continuous positive action, every hour and every day. Develop a sense of urgency. Move quickly when opportunity presents itself. Maintain a bias for action. Fast tempo is essential to success. And the faster you move, the better you will feel. The faster you move, the more energy you will have. And the faster you move, the higher will be your self-esteem and self-confidence. The world can really be divided into two categories, the talkers and the doers. The world is full of talkers who seem to be convinced that if they talk about it enough it is the same as actually doing it. But you are a doer, and it is always the doers who have been the movers and shakers throughout human history. It is the men and women who think, plan, and then take consistent, persistent action, who make things happen. When you engage in continuous action, not only will you feel terrific about yourself, but your ability to do whatever you want to do will grow by leaps and bounds. You will eventually become unstoppable!

In combination with integrity, courage is the most important quality you can have if you want to be happy and self-confident. If integrity means being honest with yourself, then courage means having the strength of mind to follow where your heart leads you. Courage means having the ability to push aside all other considerations in order to remain true to the very best that is in you. Winston Churchill said, “Courage is rightly considered the foremost of the virtues, for upon it, all others depend.” You know by now that fear is the greatest single enemy of self-confidence and self-fulfillment. It is not that people don’t know what to do; it is usually that they are afraid to do what their hearts tell them to do. However, when you build up your courage, act by act, you gradually overcome your fears. With courage, your whole world opens up before you. Your self-confidence increases. You reach the point at which there are no longer any limitations on what you will attempt and what you will commit yourself to.

Leaders are adamant about applying themselves only in those areas in which they can perform well and make a significant difference. They focus only on those areas in which they can succeed because of their special talents. One of the best questions you can ask yourself, over and over, is “What can I, and only I, do that, if done well, will make an extraordinary difference in my situation?”

Second, accept that you can change your situation only by going to work on yourself and learning the things you need to know to be better. Third, set clear goals with time lines for the things you want and then work every day to bring those goals into reality.

My conscious mind told me that these principles made sense. However, my subconscious mind, my storehouse of memories and emotions and previous experiences, was telling me that I wasn’t good enough and that success was not really for me. As my friend Zig Ziglar says, “I was engineered for success but programmed for failure.” I wanted success on the outside, but I didn’t believe I was capable of it on the inside.

The first D is desire. You must really want to become a totally self-confident human being. You must build up your desire by thinking about it and talking about it, and working on it all the time. Your desire must become so intense that it overrides your fears of failure, rejection, and inferiority, and it becomes the dominant emotion governing your behaviors. Intense desire is the starting point of all personality modification and goal attainment. The second D is decision. You must make a do-or-die decision that you will go to work on yourself and keep at it until you achieve the kind of self-confidence that enables you to do, be, and say whatever you want. You must burn your mental bridges. Many people want things but they never make the clear, unequivocal decision that they are going to do what it takes to get them. The third D is determination. Once you have started to make significant changes in the way you act, your internal gyroscope will try to take over and bring you back into your comfort zone, into your old ways of acting. Sometimes, progress will be slow, and, often, you will see no progress at all. Nonetheless, you must persist in the positive and constructive behaviors that you know will lead to making you into the kind of person you wish to become. Your determination must be as unshakable as the self-confidence you desire. The fourth D is discipline. Underlying and surrounding all great achievement in life is the quality of self-discipline. This is the ability to make yourself do what you should do, when you should do it, whether you feel like it or not. Every practice of self-discipline strengthens your discipline in every other area of your life. As Napoleon Hill said, after more than 20 years of research into the lives of successful men and women, “Self-discipline is the master key to riches.” It is self-discipline that makes everything else possible. If you have the desire to change, the decisiveness to take action, the determination to persist on your forward track, and the discipline to make yourself do whatever you need to do, your self-confidence and your success are inevitable.

Here is a key insight: Everything you do is either moving you toward one of your goals or moving you away from it. Nothing is neutral. Everything counts. Each act you engage in is either a positive act that goes on the positive side of your personal balance sheet, or it is a negative act that goes on the negative side of your personal balance sheet.

Prior to every event of importance, mentally rehearse and see yourself performing at your best in the upcoming situation. Recall and relive a previous excellent performance. Before falling asleep, think about the things you did right during the day and the things you are going to do better in the days to come. Soak your mind in positive images of you at your personal best. What you “see” is what you get.

Develop Discipline and Courage Whenever you have the choice of doing what is fun and easy rather than what is hard but necessary, force yourself out of your comfort zone in the direction of your dreams. Consciously resist the temptation to go easy on yourself. Remember that the comfort zone is the great enemy of human performance and human potential. It is only in the areas of challenge and risk that you force yourself just beyond what is comfortable and easy for you, that the possibilities of success await. Each act of courage and boldness on your part not only builds additional courage and boldness, but it also builds your self-confidence. The more often you dare to go forward, even in the face of uncertainty, the more likely it is that this type of courageous behavior will become a habit for you. You can gradually act yourself into feeling unafraid in almost all situations. There will very little that that you won’t risk or try. You will develop such confidence in yourself that you absolutely believe in your ability to succeed, even against difficult odds. Because success is based on the law of averages, you will ultimately succeed and succeed greatly.

Your self-confidence is strongly affected by your self-image. Your self-image, on the other hand, is largely determined by the way you think that other people see you. When you work hard on yourself and take the time to produce an image that you know is attractive to other people, you feel wonderful about yourself and your self-confidence goes straight up. It doesn’t matter where you’re starting from. Your main job is to decide where it is you want to go and then make a plan to get there.
